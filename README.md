## Demonstration of Monte-Carlo simulation to find the value of pi

We imagine a circle with centre and origin and radius of 100. Then a canvas square of 100 is imagined (that goes from -100 to 100 on both axes). Now randomly points are taken inside this square. The number of points to be taken should be given. When the points are randomly taken in the square, the points that lie outside the circle are destroyed. 

What we can see that, the more the test points, the more accurate our value comes close to pi.
